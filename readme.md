# Go Project

This is a Go application that includes a `main.go` file and a folder structure for organizing various parts of the project. Below are the instructions to set up, install dependencies, and run the application.

## Folder Structure

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Go installed on your system. You can download and install Go from the official site:

- [Go Installation](https://golang.org/doc/install)

## How to Run the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the project to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krvivi28/go-backend.git
   ```

2. Initialize Go Modules
   If you haven’t already, initialize Go modules in your project:
   use command : go mod tidy

3. Run the Application
   Run the Go application: go run main.go

Notes

    •	Make sure your main.go file contains the proper entry point for the Go application (package main, func main()).
    •	Any additional files or packages located in the project folder can be imported and used in main.go or other parts of the application.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, ensure that:

    •	You have Go installed and it’s in your system’s PATH.
    •	All dependencies are correctly installed using go mod tidy.
    •	The structure of your Go project is properly set up with a main package and function.

### Key Steps:

1. **Clone the repository** and move to the correct directory (`go/workspace`).
2. **Run `go mod tidy`** to install dependencies.
3. **Run `go run main.go`** to start the application.

This `README` should be easy to follow for anyone cloning and running your Go project.
